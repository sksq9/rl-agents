# MountainCar-v0

## Overview

[MountainCar-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0) is a Classic control environment and probably one of the most cited RL environment. A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.
